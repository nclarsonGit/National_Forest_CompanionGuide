        	<h2> Why visit National Forests?</h2>
        	<p>
        		National Parks are the traditional spots that tourists and campers go on a wilderness vacation, you may have heard of Yosemite or Yellowstone. However, many people miss out on the beauty of National Forests that are often located in similar ecological areas of famous National Parks. So, the question becomes, why visit a National Forest when you could go to Yellowstone and see Old Faithful? There are many reasons that make National Forests and even more intriguing option than National Parks. First, National Forests are largely free, as opposed to entry and campground fees that parks impose. This is due to the fact that National Parks largely focus on the preservation of the land, so measures are taken to ensure such preservation. National Forests, however, do have a focus on preservation, but they also have a focus on conservation and thus allow commercial activites to take place.
